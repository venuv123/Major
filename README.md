# Project - Major League Baseball Analysis

The [Lahman Baseball Dataset](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) contains complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2014, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more.


## Project Overview

In this project, we're interested in answering a few questions (see below) about [Major League Baseball](https://www.mlb.com/). To answer them, we're going to write some python, and use the [Lahman Baseball Dataset](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/)!

### Areas for Analysis

#### Analysis 1

As a University of Michigan Alumni (Go Blue!) I'm always curious which universities produce top talent. We'll look at which universities produce the most MLB All-Stars.

#### Analysis 2

The salaries that MLB players get, compared to the general population, are astronomically high. Let's look at how [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/) salaries have changed over time.

#### Analysis 3

What's also interesting, is the best players seem to get paid disproportionately high compared to the rest of the 'normal' players. Let's look at the salaries of All-Stars versus their average counterparts.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [Python (Minimum 3)](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/python-3-support-anaconda)
* [Pandas](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas)
* [Numpy](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* [Matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib)

### Data Files

* `Master.csv` - Full Set of Baseball Data
* `AllstarFull.csv` - A CSV file of MLB All-Star Players
* `CollegePlaying.csv` - A CSV file of MLB Players and their Colleges
* `Salaries.csv` - A CSV file of MLB Players and their Salaries
* `Schools.csv` - A CSV file of MLB Players and their School ID's


## Python Notebook and Scripts

* `Baseball_Data-Analysis.ipynb` - Main project file, the IPython notebook that contains the analysis.
* `baseball_data-audit.py` - Audits the baseball data for cleanliness.

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook

The project `Baseball_Data-Analysis.ipynb` can be read using a Jupyter Notebook. There's also an HTML version `Baseball_Data-Analysis.html` included for easier viewability.

* Open your Command Prompt (PC) or terminal (Mac or Linux).
* On a PC click the Start button and search for "Command Prompt".
* On a Mac type command + spacebar. Then, type "terminal" in the Spotlight Search. You can also search for "terminal" in finder.
* Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Jupyter notebook file.
* On a PC you might type: cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\, replacing your username. Learn more about basic terminal commands.
* On Mac or Linux you might type: cd ~/Downloads.
* Run the command `jupyter notebook Baseball_Data-Analysis.ipynb` in your terminal.

#### Special Note

If you try running a code block in the notebook and get an error message like 'no module named matplotlib', then your distribution of Anaconda may be missing a package used in the project. That's okay, there's an easy way that you can install these packages. Google any missing library for easy to use guides on installation!
